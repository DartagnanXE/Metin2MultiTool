# Threat Model — Telemetry / Ranking API

Concise and honest. The leaderboard is an **honor-system** feature for a hobby,
open-source bot. The security goal is **mass-protection** of the board plus hard
**isolation** of the co-hosted `kilab` stack — not making a spoof-proof score.

> **Anonymous model.** The board is an always-on **anonymous** counter keyed by a
> **random per-install id** (a `uuid4` generated once and stored client-side).
> The wire/DB field is still named `hwid` for zero-churn compatibility, but it
> **carries the random install id — it is NOT a device fingerprint.** The only
> consent / personal datum is an **optional** self-chosen display name; without
> one a row shows a deterministic anonymous name derived from the id.

## Assets

1. The leaderboard DB (a random install id + cumulative counters + a salted IP
   hash + an **optional** self-chosen name).
2. The `ADMIN_TOKEN` (block-install / hide-name / delete authority).
3. **The co-hosted `kilab` Docker stack** (the most valuable asset on the box).

## What an attacker CAN do (accepted / mitigated)

- **Rotate the install id (and pick any name).** The client is open source, so
  there is no real secret in it — a source editor can mint a new random install
  id and send any name. _Accepted._ The install id is only a stable handle for
  **mass** protection (block one installation / erase by id), not authentication,
  and is explicitly **not** a device fingerprint. Blocking an id is therefore
  mass-protection only — a new id evades it. Stated plainly, not oversold.
- **Submit junk values within the caps.** Mitigated by strict pydantic
  validation (types, length caps, numeric maxima; the name is optional/blank-
  allowed), per-IP **and** per-install rate limits (nginx **and** app-level), and
  an **implausible-jump** check that rejects a submit growing a counter far
  beyond the install's last value.
- **Scrape the leaderboard.** Mitigated by a short in-process cache + per-IP
  rate limit; the board is public by design anyway.
- **Flood the endpoint.** Mitigated by defense-in-depth limits (nginx
  `limit_req` per-IP and per-HWID + app-level buckets) and fail2ban on the
  dedicated access log. No client secret means abuse defense is 100%
  server-side — hence both layers are required.
- **Forge `X-Forwarded-For` to dodge the app per-IP limit / poison `ip_hash`.**
  Mitigated: nginx appends the real peer to any client XFF, and the app trusts
  `X-Real-IP` (set by nginx) first, else the **right-most** XFF hop — never the
  attacker-controlled left-most entry. With a front proxy, `set_real_ip_from`
  makes `$remote_addr` the true edge IP. The real ceiling was always the nginx
  per-IP `limit_req` on the true TCP peer; this just keeps the app layer + the
  stored hash honest.
- **Grow the app rate-limit map without bound (rotating identities).**
  Mitigated: the in-process bucket map is swept globally (every Nth call and
  past a hard ceiling), evicting keys with no timestamp inside the window, so it
  cannot be used as a slow memory-exhaustion vector against the 256 MB
  container.

## What an attacker CANNOT do

- **Admin without the token.** `/admin/*` and the CLI require `ADMIN_TOKEN`,
  compared with `hmac.compare_digest` (constant-time). Unset token → admin is
  disabled (fail closed). The token is never in the client. The admin axes are
  `install` (block/unblock/erase an installation by id) and `name` (hide/unhide/
  erase a chosen name); there is **no general person-ban**.
- **Pivot from a popped telemetry container to kilab.** Even with full RCE in
  this container there is **no path** to kilab because:
  - it runs on its **own** docker network (`m2fb_telemetry_net`), not kilab's;
  - it uses its **own** named volume (`m2fb_telemetry_data`), not a kilab volume;
  - it runs as a **non-root** user with a **read-only** rootfs (only `/data` and
    a tmpfs `/tmp` are writable);
  - it drops **ALL** Linux capabilities and sets `no-new-privileges`;
  - it is bound to **127.0.0.1** and exposed only through a dedicated nginx
    server-block — port 8081 is never public;
  - it shares **no secret** with kilab (separate `.env`, separate token/salt).
    The DEPLOY.md isolation checklist (`docker inspect` of network/volume/user/
    caps/ports) is the proof step before exposure.
- **Read raw client IPs.** Only a salted SHA-256 of the IP is stored
  (`IP_HASH_SALT`), so the DB holds no raw IP (GDPR).

## GDPR / transparency note

- **Collected:** a **random per-install UUID** + counters (catches,
  puzzles_solved, fishing/puzzle runtime) + app version + a **salted IP hash**.
  **No personal data** unless the user opts in by typing a chosen name.
- The anonymous counter is **always on** (there is no opt-out); the app shows a
  one-line transparency notice and the README documents the model — that notice
  is the basis the always-on counter relies on.
- The random id is **not a device fingerprint** and can be rotated by editing the
  open-source client.
- **No raw IP is stored** (salted SHA-256 only, then discarded).
- **Erasure** is supported by install id or by name (`admin.delete` / CLI
  `delete --install|--name`).

## Residual risks (accepted)

- A determined attacker can still inflate a **single** install's score within the
  per-submit caps and rate limits (e.g. slow, plausible growth). For an honor-
  system hobby board this is acceptable; block/hide/erasure handle the rest.
- Install-id rotation means a blocked installation can return under a new id, and
  a hidden name can be re-chosen. Again, **mass-protection only** — accepted and
  documented rather than overstated.

## Why kilab stays safe even if telemetry is fully compromised

The telemetry container is a sealed box: own network, own volume, non-root,
read-only FS, no caps, no shared secret, loopback-only. Compromising it yields
access to its own sqlite DB and nothing else on the host — there is no network
route, no shared mount, and no credential that reaches kilab.

"""LIVE inventory-scan orchestration -- the ONLY win32 / pydirectinput shell.

This is the thin wrapper the UI calls (on a worker thread) to run a real scan.
It adds NO recognition logic: it only builds the four callbacks
:func:`inventory.scanner.scan_inventory` already expects, then renders + diffs
the resulting :class:`~inventory.types.InventoryMap`.

  * ``capture_fn``      -> ``WindowCapture.get_screenshot`` (BGR frame)
  * ``switch_page_fn``  -> a ``pydirectinput`` click on the tab centre
  * ``verify_page_fn``  -> :func:`inventory.grid.active_page` (open-tab check)
  * ``hover_fn``        -> :meth:`_Runner._hover_clear` (the cursor sweep that
    clears the lavender glow before the de-glowed re-capture)

The hard dependencies (``pydirectinput``, :class:`WindowCapture`, ``cv2``/PIL)
are SOFT-imported so this module is IMPORT-safe headless -- the same discipline
as :mod:`windowcapture` / :mod:`inventory.assets`. The pure core
(image -> page result -> map -> diff) is fully exercised in tests by
monkeypatching these module-level names and injecting synthetic page images, so
no game is needed to test the wiring.

Differential memory: the caller (the UI) holds the previous :class:`InventoryMap`
and passes it back in as ``previous_map``; :func:`run_inventory_scan` diffs the
new scan against it and emits EXACTLY ONE warning per NEWLY-appeared unrecognised
item (never for long-standing unknowns, recognised items, or vanished slots),
and best-effort saves that item's 32x32 crop so the user can add an icon.

KNOWN LIMITATION (documented; roadmap): the inventory hotkey is a TOGGLE in
Metin2. If the inventory was ALREADY open, our open-press CLOSES it and the scan
sees no grid. We detect that (no confident slot on ANY page) and warn
``inventory.scan_not_open`` instead of dumping an all-unknown map; we do NOT
auto-press twice (racey). A future open-state probe before pressing is the fix.

ROADMAP: item HANDLING (move / use / delete a tracked key item) is out of scope.
The seam is :meth:`InventoryMap.tracked` / :meth:`InventoryMap.locations` plus
the ``tracked`` parameter here; this round only LOCATES + reports.

# 🎣 Metin2 Fishing Bot

A visual automation bot for the Metin2 fishing mini-games. It re-baits and casts
the rod automatically while fishing, and can solve the jigsaw puzzle mini-game.
Modern single-window UI — and every "smart" upgrade is **optional**: the original
behaviour is fully preserved as the default.

## ✨ Features

**Fishing** — the original core, unchanged:

- Auto re-bait, cast, and play the catch mini-game.
- Adjustable delays (0.1–20 s) for bait / cast / mini-game start.
- Optional "stop after X minutes".

**Puzzle mini-game** — original solver kept as default, improvements opt-in:

- **Solver method:** _Default_ (the original greedy + opening book) or
  _AI-optimized_ (a provably optimal strategy via exact MDP value iteration).
- **Board detection:** _Default_ (fixed position) / _Auto_ (image match) /
  _Mark_ (calibrate once with a draggable grid overlay).
- **Colour sampling:** _Single_ pixel (default) or _Multi_ pixel (more robust).

**UI & quality of life:**

- One window, one big **START / STOP** button, a **Fishing | Puzzle** switch
  (mutually exclusive), a built-in **live log**, and all settings persisted.

## 🎮 In-game setup

- Run the game in **800×600**, **windowed** (not fullscreen).
- Keep the game window **fully visible** (not minimized). This is a _visual_ bot —
  it moves your real mouse, so you can't use the PC while it runs.
- Put the **fishing skill on hotkey `1`** and the **bait on hotkey `2`**, and equip
  the rod.
- Start the app **as administrator**.
- For the puzzle: open the mini-game and don't move its window.

If your game window is not named `Metin2`, change it in `constants.py` and rebuild.

## 🛠️ Build from source

Requires **Python 3.11–3.13 (64-bit)** on Windows.

```bat
pip install -r requirements.txt
build.bat            :: -> dist\ (app) and, if Inno Setup is present, installer_output\Setup.exe
```

- **Portable single file:** `pyinstaller --noconfirm --distpath dist_onefile Metin2FishBot_onefile.spec`
- **Headless tests:** `python -m unittest discover -s tests`

## 🦠 Why does Defender sometimes flag it?

Freshly built, **unsigned** PyInstaller executables often trigger _generic
heuristic_ false-positives (e.g. `Wacatac`). This build is hardened against that
(no UPX, real PE metadata, onedir layout + installer), but only a **code-signing
certificate** removes it for certain. The portable single-file build is the most
likely to be flagged (it self-extracts on launch) — prefer the **installer** if
you run into this, and you can verify any build on [VirusTotal](https://www.virustotal.com).

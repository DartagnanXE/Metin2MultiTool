"""Open-state probe: IS the inventory open? (template match on the page tabs).

THE PROBLEM THIS SOLVES: the inventory hotkey is a TOGGLE. Every live flow
(scan, grill, discard) used to press it blindly -- if the bag was ALREADY open
(very common: the scan deliberately leaves it open) the press CLOSED it, and
every subsequent "click the page tab" landed in the 3D WORLD instead, making
the character walk off ("Bot laeuft los"). The probe answers open/closed
BEFORE anything is pressed or clicked, so the flows only toggle when needed
and ABORT (instead of clicking the landscape) when the bag cannot be verified
open.

HOW: around each of the four page tabs (I..IV, fixed calibration positions --
the same anchor :func:`inventory.grid.active_page` samples) a small patch is
matched against that tab's bundled INACTIVE-state template
(``inventory_tab_templates/tab_*.png``). Exactly one tab is always ACTIVE
(highlighted ~110 brightness units above the others, so it never matches its
inactive template); the other three match near-pixel-perfectly whenever the
inventory is open. Measured on the real captures:

  * open, inactive tab vs its template: MAD 0.0..0.6 (with +-shift search),
  * open, ACTIVE tab vs the inactive template: MAD ~39..53,
  * closed (landscape/dialog shots): MAD 26..69 on EVERY tab; a 73k-placement
    adversarial sweep over the landscape found ZERO spots where even three
    patches match (closest single patch: 26.2).

So "at least 3 of 4 tabs match" separates open from closed with a huge margin
in both directions, independent of WHICH page is active. The accept threshold
(8) sits between 0.6 and 26.2.

Headless-soft like the rest of the engine: numpy/PIL are soft imports, every
public function degrades to a clear "probe unavailable" (``None``) instead of
raising, and the pure decision logic is fully unit-testable on synthetic
canvases.

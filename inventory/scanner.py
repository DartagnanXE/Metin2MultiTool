"""Orchestration: classify a captured page, and drive a full I->IV scan.

:func:`recognize_page` is the headless unit entry -- it takes ONE already
captured page image (BGR) plus calibration, auto-aligns the grid, and returns
45 row-major :class:`SlotResult`. No game / win32 / GUI is touched.

:func:`scan_inventory` drives all four pages via two INJECTED callbacks so the
capture + input layer stays outside the engine: ``capture_fn() -> bgr_image``
and ``switch_page_fn(page) -> None``. In production these wrap
``WindowCapture.get_screenshot`` and ``pydirectinput`` tab clicks (built from
the calibration ``tabs`` + ``wincap.offset_x/y``, exactly like
:mod:`fishingbot` builds click coords). In tests they are trivial fakes -- so
the whole scanner is testable on static images.

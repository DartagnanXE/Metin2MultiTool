"""Orchestration: classify a captured page, and drive a full I->IV scan.

:func:`recognize_page` is the headless unit entry -- it takes ONE already
captured page image (BGR) plus calibration, auto-aligns the grid, and returns
45 row-major :class:`SlotResult`. No game / win32 / GUI is touched.

:func:`scan_inventory` drives all four pages via two INJECTED callbacks so the
capture + input layer stays outside the engine: ``capture_fn() -> bgr_image``
and ``switch_page_fn(page) -> None``. In production these wrap
``WindowCapture.get_screenshot`` and ``pydirectinput`` tab clicks (built from
the calibration ``tabs`` + ``wincap.offset_x/y``, exactly like
:mod:`fishingbot` builds click coords). In tests they are trivial fakes -- so
the whole scanner is testable on static images.

TWO-PHASE FAST PATH (:func:`capture_pages` + :func:`recognize_pages`):
:func:`scan_inventory` does capture and recognition INTERLEAVED per page (it
auto-aligns + classifies 45 slots before switching to the next tab), so the
game window is held for the full sequential CPU time. The fast path SPLITS that:

  * PHASE 1 -- :func:`capture_pages` only clicks I->II->III->IV and buffers ONE
    raw screenshot per tab (just switch + minimal settle + capture, NO
    recognition between tabs), then returns to tab I. The input device is busy
    for the few tab-settle pauses only.
  * PHASE 2 -- :func:`recognize_pages` then auto-aligns + classifies the 4
    buffered frames OFF the input device, running the 4x45 = 180 slot
    classifications in PARALLEL over a thread pool. The matcher is pure
    numpy/cv2 (releases the GIL), so threads give real parallelism with NO
    pickling overhead. A slot-granular ``progress_fn(done, total)`` fires as
    each slot completes (the caller marshals it onto its UI thread).

Both new functions REUSE the same recognition engine (:func:`classify_slot` /
the per-slot read in :func:`recognize_page`) -- only capture is separated from
recognition and the recognition is parallelised. They are defensive (never
raise) and importable headless; the parallel path degrades to a serial loop if
:mod:`concurrent.futures` is unavailable or one worker is requested.

    once PER buffered page (4x). This locks the grid ONCE on an anchor page and

      * ANCHOR  -- the buffered page with the MOST confident items at the

        downsampled probe). auto_align recovers the documented row-drift only

        an all-empty bag has no signal anywhere and any page (-> calibration
        origin) is equivalent.
      * REUSE   -- every page is assigned that one locked lattice; ``aligner`` is
        invoked EXACTLY ONCE (on the anchor) for a stable bag (~4x less align
        time). With 0/1 buffered pages it is also at most once.

    falls back to the calibration lattice; never raises.

    Progress: ``progress_fn(done, total)`` (best-effort, wrapped) fires after
    each slot completes, with ``total = len(captured) * 45`` and ``done``
    MONOTONICALLY increasing 1..total -- the caller marshals it onto its UI
    thread for a smooth 0..100%. ``max_workers`` defaults to a small CPU-bound
    pool; ``max_workers <= 1`` (or a missing pool) runs a serial fallback that
    fires the same progress sequence.

    OPT-IN VECTORISED PATH (``vectorized`` true; default
    :data:`VECTORIZED_DEFAULT` == off): each PAGE is recognised as ONE batched
    numpy reduction over its 45 slots (:func:`_recognize_page_vectorized`)
    instead of fanning 45 individual slot tasks; the pages then fan across the
    pool. The result map is IDENTICAL to the per-slot path (same engine, same
    numbers); progress still advances 1..total in slot units (a page contributes
    its 45 ticks when it completes) so the monotonic-1..total contract holds on
    both paths. With ``vectorized`` false the original slot-fanout path runs
    byte-for-byte unchanged.

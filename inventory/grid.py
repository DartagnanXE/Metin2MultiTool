    SESSION-CACHE fast path: the inventory window is fixed for a session, so after
    the first cold sweep the grid origin is stable. If a lock was cached for this
    (calibration, image-shape) key, probe ONLY the cached origin with a tiny dense
    +-``AUTO_ALIGN_CACHE_REFINE`` full-res sweep (:func:`_refine_around`). When that
    still locks an adequately-fitting grid (item count not collapsed vs the cached
    lock) it is reused in <<1s -- and, being centred on the previous origin, it
    reproduces the cold-sweep winner EXACTLY whenever the window is unmoved. If the
    probe's count collapsed (the window moved past the refine window) the full cold
    sweep below runs and re-seeds the cache. The cold sweep itself is unchanged, so
    the FIRST scan and any genuine re-lock are byte-identical to before.

    COLD SWEEP (:func:`_auto_align_cold`): start from ``lattice_from_calibration``
    and try integer origin offsets, choosing the offset that

        maximises   the count of slots with best masked distance <= threshold,
        then minimises the mean of those matched distances,
        then minimises ``|dx| + |dy|`` (stay closest to the calibration guess).

    Rewarding the MATCH COUNT (rather than averaging an always-positive
    occupied distance) fixes the sparse-page failure where the old objective
    slid the grid until items fell into the dark inter-slot gaps and "won" by
    registering zero occupied cells. On an ALL-empty page every candidate ties at
    (0 matches, inf mean), so the lock is geometry-arbitrary (it settles on a
    band corner near calibration) -- which is harmless: with no item in any slot,
    every origin extracts the same empty/unknown classification. The session
    cache must NOT trust that zero-count lock though (see :func:`_cache_reuse_ok`):
    a later window MOVE would otherwise be missed.

    The cold sweep (see :func:`_auto_align_cold`) has TWO stages (each can only
    pick a STRICTLY better key, so a calibration that is already correct stays
    put -- the nearer offset wins ties):

      1. PER-ROW-BAND dense sweep: for each whole-row shift
         ``k in [-row_reach..+row_reach]`` run a DENSE ``[-radius..radius]^2``
         search around ``(calib_x, calib_y + k*pitch_y)`` and keep that band's
         own best-fit representative (most matches, then lowest mean -- no
         calibration bias inside a band). The ``k != 0`` bands bridge a WHOLE-ROW
         calibration drift (an inventory sitting one slot-row off the bundled
         default), which the ``+-radius`` window alone cannot reach and which
         would otherwise drop the off-grid row + invent a phantom one. The sweep
         is dense (every integer offset) so the 1-px match-count well of a sparse
         page is never stepped over.
      2. FULL-RESOLUTION cross-band re-rank: re-score the (deduplicated) band
         representatives with the sharp full-32x32 classifier and pick the most
         confident items, then lowest mean distance, then NEAREST to the
         calibration origin (``|dx|+|dy|``). The proximity tie-break is decisive
         for a full bag, where a one-row shift is an EQUAL-quality alias -- ties
         fall back to the trusted calibration row, while a genuinely better band
         (strictly more matches) still wins on the count. There is no extra
         refine pass: each band representative is ALREADY its dense-sweep peak.

    To keep the sweep fast the scoring matches DOWNSAMPLED references
    (:meth:`ItemDB.alignment_distances`). Returns the locked
    :class:`GridLattice` (the calibration lattice unchanged if numpy is missing
